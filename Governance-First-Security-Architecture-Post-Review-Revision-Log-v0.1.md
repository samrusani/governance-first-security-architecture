# Governance-First Security Architecture - Post-Review Revision Log v0.1

## Status

Preparatory documentation.

This document is not an external review result.

This document is not prototype approval.

This document defines how external review feedback should be recorded, classified, prioritized, and converted into documentation changes before any prototype implementation decision.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to make review feedback governable.

External feedback should not become:

- informal approval,
- hidden scope change,
- undocumented authority,
- uncontrolled implementation pressure,
- untracked claim expansion.

Feedback must be captured, classified, reviewed, and resolved.

## Core Principle

```text
No review feedback becomes a model change until it is recorded, classified, scoped, and approved for documentation update.
```

## Feedback Intake Boundary

External review feedback may include:

- written comments,
- meeting notes,
- marked-up documents,
- technical critique,
- security warnings,
- compliance/privacy warnings,
- AI governance warnings,
- scope reduction advice,
- prototype boundary warnings.

External review feedback must not be treated as:

- implementation approval,
- production approval,
- security validation,
- compliance validation,
- legal advice unless explicitly provided by qualified counsel,
- authority to expand prototype scope.

## Feedback Record Template

Each feedback item should be recorded as:

## Severity Levels

### INFO

Useful comment or suggestion.

Does not block external review, prototype discussion, or documentation maturity.

### LOW

Minor clarification or wording issue.

Should be addressed but does not block next review step.

### MEDIUM

Meaningful gap, ambiguity, or improvement need.

Should be resolved before prototype implementation is discussed.

### HIGH

Serious issue affecting safety, scope, authority, egress, AI boundary, compliance language, or prototype boundary.

Blocks prototype implementation discussion until resolved.

## Triage Flow

```text
1. Record feedback.
2. Assign category.
3. Assign severity.
4. Identify affected document.
5. Identify required reviewer.
6. Decide action type.
7. Apply documentation change if approved.
8. Record linked change.
9. Mark resolved or keep blocking.
10. Update readiness estimate if material.
```

## Blocking Rules

Prototype implementation discussion must stop if any feedback item is:

- `HIGH` and unresolved,
- `CRITICAL` and unresolved,
- `BLOCKING_OPEN`,
- categorized as `DO_NOT_BUILD`,
- categorized as `PROTOTYPE_BOUNDARY` with unresolved scope concern,
- categorized as `SECURITY_RISK` with unresolved real-world impact concern,
- categorized as `LEGAL_COMPLIANCE_RISK` involving overclaim,
- categorized as `AI_GOVERNANCE_RISK` involving AI authority or self-escalation.

## Claim Control Rules

If reviewer feedback identifies an overclaim, the default action should be:

```text
WEAKEN_CLAIM
```

or:

```text
REMOVE_CLAIM
```

The model should not defend strong claims unless evidence and authority are clear.

## Prototype Impact Levels

Each feedback item should identify prototype impact:

- `NO_PROTOTYPE_IMPACT`
- `PROTOTYPE_DOC_UPDATE_ONLY`
- `PROTOTYPE_BOUNDARY_CHANGE`
- `PROTOTYPE_SCHEMA_CHANGE`
- `PROTOTYPE_TEST_CHANGE`
- `PROTOTYPE_BLOCKED`
- `PROTOTYPE_OUT_OF_SCOPE`

## Recorded Feedback

### Feedback Item GFSA-REV-014

```text
feedback_id: GFSA-REV-014
reviewer_id: EXT-TECH-003
reviewer_type: External contributor verification run (Sami); entry proposed via pull request, owner acceptance required
date_received: 2026-09-27
source_document: Phase 2 Governance Decision Simulator — governance-simulator/governance_simulator.py; governance-simulator/run_simulator.py; governance-simulator/synthetic_test_cases.yaml; governance-simulator/Prototype-Phase-2-Decision-v0.1.md
feedback_summary: Proposed Phase 2 acceptance record per Prototype-Phase-2-Decision-v0.1 acceptance criterion 5. The Phase 2 decision document was committed and owner-approved on 2026-09-27. Scope executed per commits d1894d6, 63367b7, 9baca02: STC-010 through STC-015 added (Gap O lateral peer coordination coverage and edge-case expansion), owner-recorded result 15/15 PASS. Independent contributor verification run, 2026-09-27, standalone module path (python3 governance_simulator.py): 15 PASS / 0 FAIL; all Phase 1 cases STC-001 through STC-009 unchanged and passing; Gap O synthetic tests behave per the decision doc (STC-010 signal present → INCIDENT_RESPONSE / STOP_LATERAL_PEER_COORDINATION; STC-011 signal absent → ALLOW, no false positive). NO_NETWORK GATE: returned FAIL on the contributor environment (macOS, Python 3.12.8); recorded as an environment-dependent result of the probe implementation, open finding issue #3; owner acceptance runs recorded PASS. The documented YAML runner path (run_simulator.py) fails at HEAD with an ImportError (open finding issue #5); the contributor verification therefore used the module's embedded case list, not synthetic_test_cases.yaml.

severity: MEDIUM
action_type: CLARIFY_TEXT
decision: PENDING
assigned_owner: Project owner
required_reviewer: ROLE_TECHNICAL_REVIEWER; ROLE_SECURITY_REVIEWER
status: PROPOSED
resolution_summary: Pending owner decision. If accepted as proposed: Phase 2 acceptance criteria items 1–3 recorded as met (15/15 PASS, Gap O tests pass with expected outputs, no Phase 1 regressions); item 4 qualified by the open NO_NETWORK probe finding (issue #3); item 5 satisfied by this entry; Gap O status updated from OPEN to ANALYTICALLY_ADDRESSED_IN_SIMULATOR (narrowed, not closed).
linked_change: This pull request (GFSA-REV-014 entry and Current Review State updates); open findings tracked in issues #3, #4, #5
do_not_claim_impact: This entry does not constitute security validation, compliance validation, production readiness, or authorization for Phase 3 or any prototype extension. The simulator operates on synthetic data only. Gap O is narrowed analytically and remains empirically unvalidated until tested against a real detection engine. CA-06 is not a functioning detection control. The NO_NETWORK boundary is a simulator constraint with an open portability finding, not a live network control. Because the YAML runner path is broken at HEAD, synthetic_test_cases.yaml was not executed in the contributor verification run. All results are SIMULATED_DECISION_ONLY.
prototype_impact: PROTOTYPE_TEST_CHANGE
notes: Proposed by external contributor (Sami, EXT-TECH-003) to complete the Phase 2 decision document's own completion criteria. Acceptance, rejection, and any wording changes are the project owner's decision. Three open findings are filed separately and are not resolved by this entry: issue #3 (NO_NETWORK gate environment-dependent result), issue #4 (PyYAML dependency vs stdlib-only boundary), issue #5 (run_simulator.py incompatible with governance_simulator.py at HEAD).

feedback_summary: Phase 1 acceptance test executed on 2026-09-27. NO_NETWORK GATE passed — simulator confirmed running offline. All 9 synthetic test cases (STC-001 through STC-009) passed with zero failures. Results: STC-001 BLOCK/STOP_SECRET_EXPORT, STC-002 BLOCK/STOP_MISSING_AUTHORITY, STC-003 INCIDENT_RESPONSE/STOP_INCIDENT_ACTIVE, STC-004 INCIDENT_RESPONSE/STOP_LOCKDOWN, STC-005 ALLOW/none, STC-006 ALLOW/none, STC-007 NEEDS_AUTHORITY/STOP_MISSING_AUTHORITY, STC-008 NEEDS_AUTHORITY/STOP_MISSING_AUTHORITY, STC-009 INCIDENT_RESPONSE/STOP_SECRET_EXPORT. The compound hostile signal test (STC-009) escalated correctly to INCIDENT_RESPONSE. ALLOW cases (STC-005, STC-006) passed through without false positives. All outputs marked SIMULATED_DECISION_ONLY. No real data, no live network, no real system effect.

do_not_claim_impact: This acceptance test result does not constitute security validation, compliance validation, production readiness, or authorization to implement a live system. The simulator operates on synthetic data only. Gap O remains open. CA-06 has not been empirically validated. The NO_NETWORK boundary is a simulator constraint, not a live network control. Results are SIMULATED_DECISION_ONLY.
prototype_impact: PROTOTYPE_TEST_CHANGE
notes: Phase 1 acceptance criteria defined as 9 PASS / 0 FAIL across all synthetic test cases with NO_NETWORK GATE passing. Criteria met on first run. All decisions carry SIMULATED_DECISION_ONLY label. No real data, no live integrations, no runtime authority. Phase 2 discussion is unlocked by this result but not authorized without a separate documented decision.

### Feedback Item GFSA-REV-012

```text
feedback_id: GFSA-REV-012
reviewer_id: EXT-TECH-003
reviewer_type: External technical/security reviewer (PDG-028 targeted review)
date_received: 2026-09-27
source_document: Written review of PDG-028 Review Package v0.1 (four documents: Prototype Boundary Definition, Synthetic Test Case Set, CA-06 Control Test, PDG-028 Review Package)
feedback_summary: Reviewer (Sami) completed the targeted PDG-028 external review and returned written feedback with four conditions. Condition 1a: Remove any exception in Prototype-Boundary-Definition-v0.1 that permits edited real project data; SYNTHETIC_ONLY requirement must be unqualified; define a named process responsibility for capability extension review. Condition 1b (primary blocker): Define a documented, independent NO_NETWORK verification procedure in Prototype-Boundary-Definition-v0.1 — specify who performs the check, how it is performed, and what outcome blocks first run. Condition 2: Add explicit non-use statement to STC-003 and STC-004; verify that mock values and destinations do not appear in any output or log artefacts. Condition 3: Ensure CA-06 is not described as a functioning detection control anywhere in the architecture; Gap O must be carried forward as an explicit open item in any future implementation or detection work. All four conditions were verified as implemented prior to this log entry: Condition 1a and 1b resolved in Prototype-Boundary-Definition-v0.1 during pre-review preparation; Condition 2 resolved in Synthetic-Test-Case-Set-v0.1; Condition 3 confirmed in CA-06-Control-Test-v0.1 (paper-analysis status explicit, Gap O explicitly open). PDG-028 status updated to PASS_WITH_CONDITION in Prototype-Design-Readiness-Checklist-v0.1.

affected_section: SYNTHETIC_ONLY boundary; NO_NETWORK verification procedure; STC-003 and STC-004 non-use statements; CA-06 paper-analysis scope; Gap O; PDG-028 status
feedback_category: PROTOTYPE_BOUNDARY; SECURITY_RISK; TEST_COVERAGE; DOCUMENTATION_CLARITY
severity: HIGH
action_type: CLARIFY_TEXT; NARROW_SCOPE; REQUIRE_ADDITIONAL_REVIEW
decision: ACCEPT
assigned_owner: Project owner
required_reviewer: ROLE_SECURITY_REVIEWER; ROLE_TECHNICAL_REVIEWER
status: RESOLVED
resolution_summary: All four conditions implemented and verified. Condition 1a: SYNTHETIC_ONLY boundary confirmed unqualified; capability extension review process named in Prototype-Boundary-Definition-v0.1. Condition 1b: NO_NETWORK verification procedure documented (who, how, blocking outcome) in Prototype-Boundary-Definition-v0.1. Condition 2: Non-use statement in place for STC-003 and STC-004 in Synthetic-Test-Case-Set-v0.1; mock values must not appear in outputs or logs. Condition 3: CA-06-Control-Test-v0.1 explicitly scoped as paper analysis; Gap O explicitly open and carried forward. PDG-028 updated in Prototype-Design-Readiness-Checklist-v0.1 (commit b131958).
linked_change: Governance-First-Security-Architecture-Prototype-Boundary-Definition-v0.1.md (Conditions 1a and 1b); Governance-First-Security-Architecture-Synthetic-Test-Case-Set-v0.1.md (Condition 2); Governance-First-Security-Architecture-CA-06-Control-Test-v0.1.md (Condition 3); Governance-First-Security-Architecture-Prototype-Design-Readiness-Checklist-v0.1.md (commit b131958 — PDG-028 updated)
do_not_claim_impact: Sami's review satisfies the PDG-028 external review condition. It does not authorize prototype implementation. The NO_NETWORK verification procedure must be executed before any first prototype run. Gap O remains open. CA-06 must not be described as a functioning detection control until live or prototype validation is performed. This review does not constitute security validation, compliance validation, or production readiness.
prototype_impact: PROTOTYPE_BOUNDARY_CHANGE
notes: This review satisfies the targeted external technical/security review required by PDG-028 Condition 1b. Prototype implementation remains blocked until the NO_NETWORK verification procedure is executed and its outcome recorded by the designated responsible person. Gap O remains open and must be explicitly acknowledged in any future detection or implementation work. Reviewer conflict of interest: Sami is an external reviewer with no authorship of any reviewed document. This review does not have the same self-assessment limitation as GFSA-REV-010 and GFSA-REV-011.

feedback_id: GFSA-REV-011
reviewer_id: INT-AI-001
reviewer_type: Internal AI-assisted SWOT gap remediation session (Martin Dahl + Perplexity AI)
date_received: 2026-09-26
source_document: SWOT gap list from GFSA-REV-010 internal pre-review; deferred findings 4 and 5 from GFSA-REV-010
feedback_summary: A structured remediation session was conducted on 2026-09-26 to close all seven open gaps identified across GFSA-REV-010 and the SWOT analysis. Seven items were resolved in sequence. (1) PDG-032 self-assessment risk: Prototype-Design-Readiness-Checklist updated to require a named second reviewer for PDG-032 at v1.0 gate, non-waivable; this closes GFSA-REV-010 deferred finding 4. (2) Readiness Summary Template: Checklist updated with all 32 PDG items assessed (29 PASS, 3 PASS_WITH_CONDITION); overall status READY_WITH_CONDITIONS; this closes GFSA-REV-010 deferred finding 5. (3) Threat Intelligence Intake: New document created defining intake sources (CVE/NVD, STIX/TAXII, ISAC, vendor bulletins, national authorities, PQC, regulatory signals, AI-specific research), 5-step intake flow, severity SLA table, routing rules, detection engine integration process, PCV log format, and quarterly review schedule. (4) Governance Maturity Model: New document created defining 4 maturity levels (Defined/Structured/Verified/Adaptive) across 6 dimensions (Policy Coverage, Control Implementation, Observability, Process Integrity, Evidence Quality, External Validation) with honest current-state assessment of GFSA v0.1 at 2.7/4.0; advancement roadmap tied to PDG-028 gate. (5) Provider-And-Platform-Constraints expanded from 5.3 KB memo to full governance document; added verification process (6 steps), Provider Constraint Verification Log (PCV-YYYY-NNN format, 90-day expiry), policy change monitoring (quarterly), capability assessment framework (8-question table), registered policy sources with primary URLs, documentation language constraint refinement, and review schedule. (6) ONBOARDING.md created as external reviewer quick-start guide with 5-layer architecture overview, 4 reading paths (Policy/Legal, Security/Red Team, Prototype Readiness, Review History), finding format, FAQ, and package status at a glance.

do_not_claim_impact: Completing SWOT gap remediation does not authorize prototype implementation. PDG-028 external review condition remains. Implementation authorization is NOT GRANTED. Maturity model self-assessment (2.7/4.0) is not an external validation. ONBOARDING.md does not constitute a public review launch.
prototype_impact: PROTOTYPE_DOC_UPDATE_ONLY
notes: Review methodology: structured gap-by-gap remediation with AI assistance. Same conflict-of-interest caveat as GFSA-REV-010 applies: project owner produced all changes. External reviewer (GFSA-REV-012) should be made aware that GFSA-REV-011 remediation is self-assessed and has not been independently verified. The Governance Maturity Model (Section 6) explicitly states this.

### Feedback Item GFSA-REV-010

```text
feedback_id: GFSA-REV-010
reviewer_id: INT-AI-001
reviewer_type: Internal AI-assisted pre-review (Martin Dahl + Perplexity AI)
date_received: 2026-09-26
source_document: Systematic analytical pre-review of PDG-028 review package prior to external reviewer assignment
feedback_summary: An internal pre-review of the four PDG-028 review documents was conducted by the project owner with AI assistance. Five findings were identified across the four documents. Finding 1 (critical, resolved): PDG-028 Question 2 referenced STC-005 and STC-006 as "Secret Export Attempt" and "Sensitive Personal Data Export", but the Synthetic Test Case Set numbers those scenarios STC-003 and STC-004; the actual STC-005 and STC-006 cover AI self-escalation and hidden capability. This reference error would likely cause an external reviewer to question documentation integrity. Finding 2 (medium, resolved): PDG-028 Question 1 did not specify who is responsible for independently verifying that network isolation (NO_NETWORK) is in place before the prototype runs for the first time. Finding 3 (medium, resolved): PDG-028 Question 3 described Scenarios 3 and 4 as CA-06's open gaps but omitted Scenario 2, which is only conditionally detectable and requires an unverified infrastructure capability. Finding 4 (low, resolved via GFSA-REV-011): PDG-032 (no hidden capability) does not specify who has authority to decide whether a proposed addition constitutes hidden capability expansion, creating a potential self-assessment risk. Finding 5 (low, resolved via GFSA-REV-011): The Readiness Summary Template in the Prototype Design Readiness Checklist has never been formally filled in; this will be required before Prototype-Implementation-Plan-v0.1 can be opened after a successful external review.

Findings 4 and 5 deferred at GFSA-REV-010 and fully resolved via GFSA-REV-011 (2026-09-26): PDG-032 self-assessment risk addressed by requiring named second reviewer at v1.0 gate; Readiness Summary Template completed with all 32 PDG items assessed. All five findings closed.

do_not_claim_impact: This internal pre-review does not satisfy the PDG-028 external reviewer requirement. It does not constitute external challenge of the prototype boundary. It does not authorize prototype implementation. PDG-028 status remains BLOCKED until an external reviewer is assigned and returns a written response.
prototype_impact: PROTOTYPE_DOC_UPDATE_ONLY
notes: Review methodology: paper-based analytical assessment, identical to the methodology used in CA-06-Control-Test-v0.1. No live systems, real agents, or real data involved. The pre-review was conducted with full transparency about the reviewer's identity and conflict of interest (same party that produced the documents). This transparency is recorded here as part of the audit trail. An external reviewer should be made aware that this pre-review was conducted and that findings 4 and 5 were deferred and subsequently resolved via GFSA-REV-011.

### Feedback Item GFSA-REV-009

```text
feedback_id: GFSA-REV-009
reviewer_id: EXT-TECH-002
reviewer_type: External technical reviewer
date_received: 2026-09-26
source_document: Written review response after GitHub repository review
feedback_summary: Reviewer acknowledges that the project raises important and legitimate questions: who may instruct an AI agent, what authority it holds, when it must be stopped, and how decisions can be audited. The reviewer's central objection is to the framing: the work is a documented proposal, not a tested security solution. Specifically, there is no evidence that the method can protect an organisation against an attack involving multiple coordinated AI agents. The reviewer finds the honeypot idea — silently moving a hostile agent to a simulated environment — interesting but unproven at the level of implementability described. Recommendation: present the work as a review framework, not a proven solution. Proposed next step: test one bounded control against realistic attacks and report both successes and failures.

decision: ACCEPT
assigned_owner: Project owner
required_reviewer: ROLE_TECHNICAL_REVIEWER; ROLE_SECURITY_REVIEWER
status: IN_REVISION
resolution_summary: Three of four action items completed as of 2026-09-26. (1) Project framing confirmed correct — README already presents the work as a documented proposal, not a proven solution; no change required. (2) Honeypot implementability caveat added to Active-Neutralization-Runbook-v0.1 Section 9: the mechanism is conceptual and untested and must not be treated as operationally available until independent technical validation is completed. (3) Multi-agent coordination gap registered: Red-Team-Findings-v0.2 Gap O records that CA-06 establishes the control rule but empirical validation has not been performed; CA-06-Lateral-Peer-Coordination-Rule-v0.1 created as the governing rule document. (4) Bounded control test produced: CA-06-Control-Test-v0.1 is a paper-based analytical assessment of CA-06 across four scenarios — two where the control fires correctly, two where it does not. The test explicitly documents detection boundaries and confirms that Gap O remains open until a live or prototype test against a real detection engine is conducted. Status is IN_REVISION, not RESOLVED, because empirical validation of the multi-agent coordination control has not been performed.
linked_change: Active-Neutralization-Runbook-v0.1 (Section 9 caveat); Red-Team-Findings-v0.2 (Gap O registered); CA-06-Lateral-Peer-Coordination-Rule-v0.1 (new document); CA-06-Control-Test-v0.1 (new document)
do_not_claim_impact: Do not claim that the architecture has been demonstrated to protect against coordinated multi-agent attacks. Do not claim that the honeypot/deception mechanism is implementable as described without independent technical validation. Do not claim the project is a proven security solution. Do not claim that CA-06 has been empirically validated.

notes: Reviewer's framing distinction — review framework versus proven solution — is consistent with the existing documentation posture and the documentation-only freeze. The multi-agent coordination coverage concern is partially addressed by CA-01 through CA-05 in Monitoring-And-Detection-Operations-v0.1 and by GFSA-RED-TEAM-FINDINGS-v0.1 Gap C, but those documents do not claim empirical validation. The honeypot/deception mechanism in Active-Neutralization-Runbook-v0.1 now carries an explicit unproven-implementability caveat. The bounded control test (CA-06-Control-Test-v0.1) addresses Sami's recommendation analytically. Gap O remains open and is explicitly documented as such.

```text
feedback_id: GFSA-REV-008
reviewer_id: OWNER-PUB-002
reviewer_type: Project owner public-release authorization and verification
date_received: 2026-08-21
source_document: Explicit public-release approval and completed GitHub post-release verification
feedback_summary: The project owner explicitly approved public release after the private render, contact-route, access, content-boundary, and documentation checks were completed. The approved release sequence required removal of the merged remote preparation branch, disabling empty Wiki and Projects features, changing repository visibility to public, adding a bounded topic set, enabling private vulnerability reporting, and verifying the external visitor reporting action before any public review outreach.

feedback_id: GFSA-REV-007
reviewer_id: EXT-TECH-001
reviewer_type: External technical and pre-publication reviewer
date_received: 2026-08-21
source_document: Private pre-publication follow-up and practical-use summary
feedback_summary: The reviewer confirmed the private-first release sequence and identified two owner-controlled prerequisites before public visibility: a project-safe contact route visible on the public GitHub profile and explicit owner approval. After any approved visibility change, private vulnerability reporting should be enabled and its public reporting path verified before review outreach. The reviewer also recommended checking direct collaborator access and noted optional cleanup of empty repository features. A separate practical-use summary distinguished review, workshop, and licensed vocabulary reuse from live control-plane use, security or compliance claims, and unauthorized prototype development.

reviewer_type: Private GitHub launch and platform-gate verification
date_received: 2026-08-15
source_document: Private repository launch, rendered GitHub review, and current GitHub platform documentation
feedback_summary: The frozen package was published to a private GitHub repository and its initial commit identity, license detection, README, Mermaid diagram, citation metadata, issue form, review label, document index, pull-request template, links, description, and visibility were checked. The existing release gate incorrectly assumed that GitHub private vulnerability reporting could be enabled while the repository remained private. Current GitHub documentation limits that feature to public repositories and also states that repository topic names are public even when a repository is private.

reviewer_type: Project owner licensing and identity decision
date_received: 2026-08-15
source_document: Open-collaboration, attribution, and project-identity decision
feedback_summary: The public architecture project should invite governance coders and builders to continue the work while preserving clear attribution to Martin Dahl, an identifiable canonical source, and a distinction between official project revisions and independent forks or implementations. The current work should be called an architecture project rather than a platform. Future code, if separately authorized, should use a code-specific license that preserves modifications to original project files without forcing an entire larger work under the same license.

reviewer_type: Independent pre-publication consistency and GitHub-release audit
date_received: 2026-08-15

feedback_summary: Several core reviewer documents described an earlier package state; current lifecycle mode was inconsistently recorded as LM-0 rather than LM-1; action, risk, evidence, egress, and stop-state vocabularies lacked explicit canonical mappings; release checks implied completion before a private repository existed; local Git authorship did not match the public project identity; the short custom license notice could prevent standard license detection; community conduct and confidential-reporting gates were incomplete; and one provider reference linked to an announcement rather than the current direct policy.

reviewer_id: EXT-COM-001
reviewer_type: Venture capital / commercial strategy reviewer
date_received: 2026-07-04
source_document: Commercial review follow-up response based on prior PDF/package
feedback_summary: Reviewer sees a real problem space around AI governance, decision accountability, auditability, stop states, evidence, and human/AI boundaries. Reviewer advises that the strongest commercial angle is not a new security architecture or security platform, but a narrow advisory/assessment offer for regulated companies or enterprise SaaS teams that need to show customers, boards, legal, or risk teams how sensitive AI-assisted decisions are controlled and reviewed. Reviewer does not yet see clear evidence of product-market fit or a venture-scale product, warns that the concept remains abstract and broad, and recommends not building software yet. Recommended market test is 2-3 tightly scoped paid workshops or assessments around one concrete pain: which AI/security decisions can be allowed, blocked, escalated, exported, and audited.

## Readiness Update Rule

Readiness estimates should be updated after material feedback is resolved.

Do not increase readiness if:

- high-severity findings are open,
- critical findings are open,
- external reviewer says do not prototype,
- prototype boundary is unclear,
- overclaim risk increased,
- test coverage became weaker.

Readiness may increase only if:

- risks are narrowed,
- claims are weakened,
- boundary is clearer,
- tests are stronger,
- roles are clearer,
- stop states are more precise,
- implementation remains non-authorized.

## Current Decision

This revision log process is ready to receive external review feedback.

It does not authorize:

- implementation,
- runtime,
- automation,
- live integrations,
- real data,
- security claims,
- compliance claims.
